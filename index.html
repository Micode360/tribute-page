                    <p>It's an honor for we, the board of directors of Barcelona FC to honor the following players for their efforts which led the team to victories overr the recent seasons. We believe all team members have done a great job and we use this
                        opportunity to say congrats to them as well, but these players made it possible for the team to become as strong as they are today. And have created effective princples that can be built upon in the later seasons.

                <h1>Luis Saurez</h1>
                <p></p>Luis Suarez is a fantastic talent and a very dangerous player. He is a fantastic team mate, probably the best player any team can have. He is a player who defines the style shift at Barcelona and also a player who I think was very
                necessary for Barcelona. He is the closest thing they have had to Samuel Eto’o and the perfect player to fit with Messi and Neymar.

                <h1>Lionel Messi</h1>
                <p>Messi is undoubtedly the best player in the world. He’s the determining factor. He’s key, he controls the pace, he directs above all the team’s attack. Messi is a treasure because he is a role model for children around the world… Messi
                    will be the player to win the most Ballons d’Or in history. He will win five, six, seven. He is incomparable. He’s in a different league.

                <h1>Authur Melo</h1>
                <p>Arthur is a very quick thinker. He has a natural talent, but, most of all, he has a lot of room to improve through training. He is already a mature player and he has massive untapped potential. He comes out of a tricky situation with ease.
                    He has a strong personality
